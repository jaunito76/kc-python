# War Card Game:

## Game Description:

"War" is a two-player card game where the goal is to win all the cards. The deck is shuffled, and each player is dealt half of the cards. In each round, players reveal the top card of their deck, and the player with the higher-ranked card wins both cards. The game continues until one player has all the cards.

# Object-Oriented Concepts to Implement:

## Card Class:

Create a Card class to represent individual playing cards.
Include attributes like rank and suit.

## Deck Class:

Implement a Deck class to represent the deck of cards.
Include methods for shuffling the deck, dealing cards, and possibly displaying the deck.

## Player Class:

Create a Player class to represent each player in the game.
Include attributes like name and a hand of cards.
Implement methods for drawing cards and winning a round.

## Game Class:

Implement a Game class to manage the overall game logic.
Handle rounds, compare cards, and determine the winner.

# Example Code Skeleton:

```python
import random
class Card:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        # Initialize card attributes

class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize a deck of cards

    def shuffle(self):
        # Shuffle the deck

    def deal(self, num_cards):
        # Deal a specified number of cards

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        # Initialize player attributes

    def draw_card(self):
        # Draw a card from the player's hand

    def add_cards(self, cards):
        # Add cards to the player's hand

    def is_out_of_cards(self):
        # Check if the player is out of cards

class Game:
    def __init__(self, player1, player2):
        # Initialize the game with two players

    def play_round(self):
        # Play a round of the game

    def play_game(self):
        # Play the entire game until one player wins
```

# Create instances of the classes and run the game

This project allows students to practice creating classes for representing cards, managing a deck, and handling player interactions in a game setting. They can extend the project by adding features like keeping score, introducing more complex card mechanics, or even creating a graphical interface for the game.
