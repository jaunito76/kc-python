# God's Kingdom Crusaders - Introduction to Computer Science
The intent of this repository is teach students computer science through the use of the Python programming language. This repository will be used to expose the students to a Git type repository.   

The book that we are using is _Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_ by John V. Guttag. This course will loosely follow through the online course (MOOC) from MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python available throughout the year at [edX](https://www.edx.org/) for which the book was written.
